# Changelog

## v0.3.0
- Added directional NeedleArt slots to Vesticrest
- Removed previous unlocking logic (now uses the SimpleUnlock logic)

> <strong>Dev Comments:</strong>
>
> My original plan for this mod was to make it an addition that integrated into the normal progression of the game such as unlocking arts overtime, and eventually a custom crest focused around NeedleArts.
> I have decided to remove the unlocking system as it forced me to do some weird auto equips, that wasn't very intuitive to use.
> To make a fully custom crest is a decent amount of work, and I've realised I would never get it to polished state I would be happy with any time soon, so for now I will just let any crest use all 3 NeedleArt slots.
