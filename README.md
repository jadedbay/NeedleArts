# NeedleArts

A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod, adds the ability to equip Needle Strikes from other crests.

## Features
- Adds a new tool type NeedleArt (orange) and a slot to each crest with this type.

- Adds a new NeedleArt tool for each crest, equipping tool associated with crest will use that crest's Needle Strike instead.

### Balancing / Progression
- The slot won't appear until Needle Strike is unlocked.

- To unlock a crest's Needle Strike/Art as a tool, you must unlock all tool slots on that crest. (Alternatively if you just want to play around with the mod there is a button in the mod menu to unlock Needle Strike and all NeedleArts tools.)

## Future Plans
- Add custom Needle Arts

- Add custom crest focused around Needle Strike/Art (Equip multiple and use directional to use, similar to HK)

- Add custom tools to buff Needle Strike/Art

- Update Needle Art tool icons
