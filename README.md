A Hollow Knight: Silksong mod, adds the ability to equip Needle Strikes from other crests.

*Thunderstore*: https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/jadedbay/NeedleArts/

*GitHub*: https://github.com/jadedbay/NeedleArts

## Features
- Adds a new tool type NeedleArt (orange) and adds this slot to the Vesticrest.

- Adds a new NeedleArt tool for each crest, equipping tool associated with crest will use that crest's Needle Strike instead.

### Balancing / Progression
The new NeedleArt slot won't appear until Needle Strike is unlocked, to unlock a crest's Needle Strike/Art as a tool, you must unlock all tool slots on its respective crest (There is an option in the config to change this to only need the crest unlocked to also unlock its NeedleArt). 

If you just want to play around with the mod there is a button in the config to unlock Needle Strike and all Needle Arts.
